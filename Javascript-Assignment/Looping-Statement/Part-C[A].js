// Q1) Write a for loop that searches for the first occurrence of the number 7 in an array. As soon as it finds 7, print its index and stop the loop using break.


let arr = [45,5,7,5,2,6,95]
for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i]==7){
        console.log("Index:",i)
        break
    }
}


// Q2) Simulate a simple password checker: keep asking the user for a password (using a for loop that runs maximum 5 times). If the correct password is entered, print “Access granted” and break. If all 5 attempts fail, print “Account locked”.


let password = "abc@123"
let enteredPass = "abc@123"
let i=0
for (; i<5; i++){
    if (password===enteredPass){
        console.log("Access granted")
        break
    }
}
if (i==5){
    console.log("Account Blocked")
}


// Q3) Write a for loop that adds numbers from 1 onwards until the sum exceeds 100. Print the last number that was added before the sum crossed 100 and stop using break.


let sum=0;
for (let i=0; sum<100; i++){
    sum+=i
    if (sum>=100){
        console.log(i-1)
        break
    }
}


// Q4) Given an array of names, use a for loop to find the first name that starts with the letter “S”. Print that name and immediately stop the loop with break.


let names = ["Vishal", "Grency", "Freya", "Nayan", "Sweni", "Utsav", "Chetan"]
for (let i=0; i<names.length; i++){
    if (names[i][0]=="S"){
        console.log(names[i])
        break
    }
}


// Q5) Create a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 50. Stop completely (break) as soon as you encounter a number that is both a perfect square and greater than 20.


for (let i=1; i<=50; i++){
    console.log(i)
    if (i>20 && i**(1/2)===Math.floor(i**(1/2))){
        break
    }
}
